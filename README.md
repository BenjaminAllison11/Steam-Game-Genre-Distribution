<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


I started going to college in January 2023 for a computer science degree, but I felt like I wasn't learning much and so I felt really lost and like I wasn't going anywhere. I realized that I had two issues with my education. One, a lot of the work was reading instead of building projects that I can use, so I felt like I wasn't learning a lot and two, the work didn't feel relevant or fun to me, which didn't make me want to put in more effort. To fix both of these issues, I decided I needed to build a project of my choosing without using any tutorials and that would be relevant to me and my life. I play a lot of video games and I thought it would be interesting to figure out the makeup of my Steam library. I had a rough idea of what genre of games would be at the top, but I wanted to know a percentage and that's when I figured that I could just build a program to find that information out for me.

### Built With

The project is built in Python version 3.11.3. The libraries used are:

python-steam-api-https://pypi.org/project/python-steam-api/
giantbomb-redux-https://pypi.org/project/giantbomb-redux/
Matplotlib-https://matplotlib.org/

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get started, download the py file and create an env file to house your API keys. For somereason the giantbomb API key would not work for me when stored in the env file, so I had to put it into the main py file.

### Prerequisites

The software you need to install are:
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
pip install giantbomb-redux
pip install python-steam-api

### Installation



Get your Steam API key here: https://steamcommunity.com/dev#:~:text=Obtaining%20an%20Steam%20Web%20API%20Key%20All%20use,agree%20to%20the%20Steam%20API%20Terms%20of%20Use.
Get your GiantBomb API key here: https://www.giantbomb.com/api/
